decomp-toolkit Project Template
===============================

If starting a new GameCube / Wii decompilation project, this repository can be used as a scaffold.

See [decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) for background on the concept and more information on the tooling used.

Features
--------

- Few external dependencies: Just `python` for the generator and `ninja` for the build system. See [Dependencies](docs/dependencies.md).
- Simple configuration: Everything lives in `config.yml`, `symbols.txt`, and `splits.txt`.
- Multi-version support: Separate configurations for each game version, and a `configure.py --version` flag to switch between them.
- Feature-rich analyzer: Many time-consuming tasks are automated, allowing you to focus on the decompilation itself. See [Analyzer features](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit#analyzer-features).
- REL support: RELs each have their own `symbols.txt` and `splits.txt`, and will automatically be built and linked against the main binary.
- No manual assembly: decomp-toolkit handles splitting the DOL into relocatable objects based on the configuration. No game assets are committed to the repository.
- Progress calculation and upload script for [frogress](https://github.com/decompals/frogress).
- Integration with [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) for a diffing workflow.
- CI workflow template for GitHub Actions.
